Data 512 A7 - Covid-19 Project .  The goal of this project is to explore the impact of Covid-19 mask mandate on local security and whether there is a correlation between the two factors in the city of Hartford, CT, and apply and practice human-centered data science. 



## Introduction
- In the nearly two years since the Covid-19 outbreak, the pandemic is affecting every aspect of our lives. At the same time, some changes have taken place in social security during the pandemic period, which are precisely related to people's daily life.The safety and crime rate of an area are critical to the quality of well-being of local people, and they are also important human-centered concerns. As a human-centered data science project, this study is aimed at exploring the impact of Covid-19 mask mandate on local security and whether there is a correlation between the two factors. The main target location for the research is Hartford city, Connecticut. 
- The results of this project showed that there was no significant correlation between the number of crimes and the number of confirmed cases in Hartford. There is a difference in crimesâ€™ volume before and after the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is not significant. Meanwhile, through this project, I have completed a practice and application of human-centered data science. The research process deepened my understanding of what I learned in class and expanded my knowledge.
